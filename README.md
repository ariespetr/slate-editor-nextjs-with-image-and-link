<strong>Please Note</strong>
<br>
Before using this repo it is assumed that you are a student of the 
Complete Next.js with React & Node - Beautiful Portfolio App on Udemy by Filip Jerga because this repo
does not contain the whole projects source code. This is just a fractional part of the Course that 
shows how to integrate image and links into the Slate Editor used in the course.

Just make necessary updates to the respective files....

Thanks
